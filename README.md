<h2>Too many options?</h2>
I feel spread thin when I have too many thoughts on a topic:
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Which thoughts should be priorities...
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Have my priorities changed...?

<h2>Reflection is a bare-bones, very minimal Journal for reflecting on priorities.</h2>
Create a Journal and, over time, iterate over what Thoughts are still valuable to you:

Create a "Healthy Diet Journal"
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Day 1-> Apples, Oranges, Kale, Walnuts
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Day ?-> ~~Apples,~~ Oranges, ~~Kale,~~ Walnuts, Multi-Vitamin, Salmon -> ...
<\br>
<\br>

Create a "Healthy Body Journal"
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Day 1-> 12am bedtime, Gym, Walk, Stretch
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Day ?-> ~~12am bedtime,~~ Gym, ~~Walk,~~ ~~Stretch~~ 11pm bedtime, Jog, Yoga -> ...
<\br>
<\br>

Create a "Todo Journal"
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Day 1-> Finish Reflection App, Produce Music
<\br>
<space><space><space><space>Day ?-> ~~Finish Reflection App,~~ Produce Music, Hike Pantera Park, Cook Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup -> ...
<\br>
<\br>

<h2>Create a "Journal" for any set of Thoughts in your life.</h2>
List the important Thoughts.
<\br>
Go outside.
<\br>
Come back and decide which ones still matter to you.
