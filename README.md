## Too many options?
I feel spread thin when I have too many thoughts on a topic:
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thoughts should be priorities...
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have my priorities changed...?

## Reflect on priorities.
Reflection is a bare-bones, very minimal Journal for reflecting on priorities.
<br/>
Create a Journal and, over time, iterate over what Thoughts are still valuable to you:

Create a "Healthy Diet Journal"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 1-> Apples, Oranges, Kale, Walnuts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day ? -> ~~Apples,~~ Oranges, ~~Kale,~~ Walnuts, Multi-Vitamin, Salmon -> ...
<br/>

Create a "Healthy Body Journal"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 1-> 12am bedtime, Gym, Walk, Stretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day ? -> ~~12am bedtime,~~ Gym, ~~Walk,~~ ~~Stretch~~ 11pm bedtime, Jog, Yoga -> ...
<br/>

Create a "Todo Journal"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 1-> Finish Reflection App, Produce Music
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day ? -> ~~Finish Reflection App,~~ Produce Music, Hike Pantera Park, Cook Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup -> ...

## Simple Journaling
Create a "Journal" for any set of Thoughts in your life.
List the important Thoughts.
Go outside.
Come back and decide which ones still matter to you.
