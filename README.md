## Too many options?
I feel spread thin when I have too many thoughts on a topic:
>Which thoughts should be priorities...?

>Have my priorities changed...?

## Reflect on priorities.
Create a Journal and iterate over what Thoughts are still valuable to you:


>
>Create a "Healthy Diet Journal"\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 1-> Apples, Oranges, Kale, Walnuts\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day ? -> ~~Apples,~~ Oranges, ~~Kale,~~ Walnuts, Multi->Vitamin, Salmon -> ...

>Create a "Healthy Body Journal"\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 1-> 12am bedtime, Gym, Walk, Stretch\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day ? -> ~~12am bedtime,~~ Gym, ~~Walk,~~ ~~Stretch~~ 11pm bedtime, Jog, Yoga -> ...

>Create a "Todo Journal"\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 1-> Finish Reflection App\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day ? -> ~~Finish Reflection App,~~ Produce Music, Hike Pantera Park, Cook Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup -> ...


## Simple Journaling
1. Create a "Journal" for any set of Thoughts in your life.
2. List the important Thoughts.
3. Go outside.
4. Decide which Thoughts still matter to you.
